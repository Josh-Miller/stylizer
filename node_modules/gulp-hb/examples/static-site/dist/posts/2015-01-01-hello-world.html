		<p>I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.</p>

		<p>I call it luck. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money.</p>

			<li>Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.</li>
			<li>She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!</li>

		<p>She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time! Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like&hellip;suicide.</p>

		<h4>The Rebel Force</h4>
		<p>I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. You mean it controls your actions? I care. So, what do you think of her, Han?</p>

			<li>You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away!</li>
			<li>The Force is strong with this one. I have you now.</li>
			<li>The Force is strong with this one. I have you now.</li>
			<li>Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone.</li>

		<h5>The Empire Strikes Back</h5>
		<p>Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. Ye-ha! You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away!</p>
